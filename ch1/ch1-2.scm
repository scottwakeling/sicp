; 1.2 Procedures and the Processes They Generate

; 1.2.1 Linear Recursion and Iteration

; A linear recursive process in a recursive procedure
;  (factorial 6)
;  (* 6 (factorial 5))
;  (* 6 (* 5 (factorial 4)))
;  etc. - builds up a chain of *deferred operations*

(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))

; A linear iterative process in a recursive procedure
;  (factorial 6)
;  (fact-iter 1 1 6)
;  (fact-iter 1 2 6)
;  (fact-iter 2 3 6)
;  etc. - state is captured in state variables, no stack required

(define (factorial n)
  (fact-iter 1 1 n))

(define (fact-iter product counter max-count)
  (if (> counter max-count)
      product
      (fact-iter (* counter product)
		 (+ counter 1)
		 max-count)))

; Don't confuse a recursive process with a recursive procedure

; 'Tail Recursive'
; Iterative processes CAN execute in constant space, with no stack,
;  language implementations with this property are called *tail recursive*

; ex 1.9

; substitution model shows this process is recursive
;  (as is the procedure, *indirectly*)

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9

; substitution model shows this process is iterative
;  (the procedure is stil indirectly recursive)

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

(+ 3 6)

; 1.2.2 Tree Recursion

(define (fib n)
  (cond ((= n 0) 0)
	((= n 1) 1)
	(else (+ (fib (- n 1))
		 (fib (- n 2))))))

; substitution shows this to be an exponential tree of recursive
;  calls - I'm not going to even try typing it out, even for (fib 4)

; fib calls itself *twice* each time it's invoked, not just once
;  like 'normal' recursive procedures - the steps it takes grow
;  exponentially with its input, but the space (stack) grows
;  only linearly. Steps is no. of NODES in the recursive tree
;  diagram, space (max. stack size at any point) is tree DEPTH

; ridiculous amounts of redundant computation with this approach
;  over half the recursive tree diagram of (fib 5) is redundant
;  computation of (fib 3) (memoization..)

; here's an iterative fibonacci process

(define (fib n)
  (fib-iter 1 0 n))

(define (fib-iter a b count)
  (if (= count 0)
      b
      (fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1))))

; SO much faster, and can be done in constant space (no stack)
;  with a tail recursive interpreter

; BUT, the tree-recursive process was way easier to formulate
;  the linear iteration required noticing that fib could be
;  recast as a process with three state variables

; it essentially carries a running total along with it

(fib 4)
(fib-iter 1 0 4)
;(fib-iter (+ 1 0) 1 3)
(fib-iter 1 1 3)
;(fib-iter (+ 1 1) 1 2)
(fib-iter 2 1 2)
;(fib-iter (+ 2 1) 2 1)
(fib-iter 3 2 1)
;(fib-iter (+ 3 2) 3 0)
(fib-iter 5 3 0)

; linear process, recursive procedure, fast as fuck! ;-)


; EXAMPLE: count-change problem (tree recursive version)

(define (count-change amount)
  (cc amount 3))

(define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 10)
	((= kinds-of-coins 2) 20)
	((= kinds-of-coins 3) 50)))

(define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
	((or (< amount 0) (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 0)
	(else (+ (cc amount
		          (- kinds-of-coins 1))
		  (cc (- amount
			 (first-denomination kinds-of-coins))
		           kinds-of-coins)))))

; Still, tree recursive processes can be made more efficient
;  by avoiding redundant computation. One such way is to
;  tabulate intermediate results (e.g. (fib 3)). This is
;  'tabulation' or 'memoization' - it can be
;  straightforward to implement and can transform processes
;  that require exp. no. of steps into processes whose
;  space and time requirements grow only linearly with input

; 1.2.3 Orders of Growth

; linear recursive process
;   no. of steps grows in proportion to the input n -> O(n) ('theta of n')
;   space requirements also grow with n -> O(n)

; linear iterative process
;   time -> O(n)
;   space -> O(1) (i.e. constant space)

; tree recursive
;   time -> O(k^n) (i.e. nodes in tree, or, rows in expansion)
;   space -> O(n) (i.e. max. depth of tree (the stack))

; O(log n) is better than linear, it's like binary searching a phone book for
;  someone's name and number instead of having to check every page (O(n))
;   remember, log(n) decelerates as n increases.. for large values of n it
;   beats O(n) by a country mile

(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x)

       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

; a - (12.15, 5 times) (24.3, 5 times), (125, 7 times)
; b - R(n) is O(log n) (doubling n produces a constant increase in space req.)

;  b^n = (b^(n/2))^2 (if n is even)
